Football refers to a number of sports that involve, to varying degrees, 
kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the 
regional context in which the word appears: association football (known as soccer 
in some countries) in the United Kingdom; gridiron football (specifically American
 football or Canadian football) in the United States and Canada; Australian rules football
 or rugby league in different areas of Australia; Gaelic football in Ireland; and rugby
 football (specifically rugby union) in New Zealand.[1][2] These different variations 
of football are known as football codes.Various forms of football can be identified in history, 
often as popular peasant games. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to 
the codification of these games at English public schools in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries.[3][4] The expanse of the British Empire allowed these rules 
of football to spread to areas of British influence outside of the directly 
controlled Empire,[5] though by the end of the nineteenth century, distinct 
regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
 incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain 
 their heritage.[6] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming 
 the first of many professional football competitions. During the twentieth century, 
 several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular 
 team sports in the world football (specifically rugby union) in New Zealand.[1][2] These different variations
